**Abstract**: Recently, Christian and Hollenberg proposed and solved a new class of initial orbit determination problems based only on velocity measurements. We introduce a modification to the velocity-based initial orbit determination algorithm to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. Orbit determination error trends with respect to semi-major axis, eccentricity, initial true anomaly, and sensor noise are modeled using the orbit hodograph, and verified using Monte Carlo simulations. An example is provided to show that error trend models can accurately predict the error of hodograph-based velocity initial orbit determination algorithms.
